## used the following to create MYSQL + NODEjs

```javascript
const uniqid = require("uniqid"); //to create unique primary ID 
const mysql = require("mysql"); //to stablish connection to mysql DB
const inquirer = require("inquirer"); //to create user interface via terminal
```

# use .sql script to create the database

## Overview

In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.
